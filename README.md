# 👋 Hi, I'm Aaron Calderón Sánchez
## Data Analyst | Credit Risk | Data Science

I'm a Data-driven Credit Risk and Financial Analytics professional with experience in loan servicing, distressed portfolios, credit underwriting support, and performance analytics across fintech and banking institutions.
Proven ability to transform complex financial and operational data into actionable insights that improve recovery rates, reduce risk exposure, and optimize portfolio performance.

🧑‍💻 I’m currently working on a Fintech, managing a distressed U.S. small-business loan portfolio, implementing restructuring strategies to improve recovery rates and overall portfolio performance. I analyze delinquency trends and transactional data to mitigate default risk and credit risk exposure, using an aging report and a classification by business type, allowing the timely implementation of relief plans.
One project I developed was the automation of recurring reports and workflows using SQL and Excel, improving data accuracy. Such as reports of returned payments to maintain control over payments and keep the return rate below 15%.

 🎓 I’m currently learning Data Science in a Bootcamp (machine learning, statistical analysis, and big data management). Experienced in building predictive models using Python, Seaborn, pandas, and SQL, with a proven track record of optimizing business
strategies. Skilled at translating data into effective solutions and making data-driven decisions.
